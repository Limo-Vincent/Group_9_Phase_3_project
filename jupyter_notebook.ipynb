    "#### 1.1 Business Overview  \n",
    "Customer churn, where subscribers discontinue services or switch to competitors, is a major challenge in the telecom industry. A [2024 study by Alisha Sikri and colleagues](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-63750-0), published in Scientific Reports emphasizes that retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones, making churn prediction a strategic priority.  \n",

    "Syriatel, one of Syriaâ€™s largest telecom providers with over 6 million active customers and a 55% market share, faces rising churn despite strong coverage and service reliability. This project leverages machine learning to predict at-risk customers, enabling proactive retention strategies that improve loyalty, optimize resources, and sustain profitability.  \n"

    "Syriatel is struggling with rising customer churn, which threatens its revenue and market position. The company lacks a clear way to know customers that are likely to leave. Without timely insights, Syriatel risks losing more customers to competitors and incurring higher costs to replace them. Developing a predictive solution is critical to identify at-risk customers early and take proactive steps to retain them.  \n"
